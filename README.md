# Yet Another Agile Manager (YAAM)  
  
## Introduction  
Here is where you motivate some of your own ideas and describe your customer.  
  
  
## Product Reviews  
### [Agilean](https://agilean.in/) 
Agilean is an online SaaS agile development team management system. Agilean comes in two flavors. The Kanban flavor and the scrum flavor. This changes how task progress is managed and viewed. Kanban supports a more continuous work flow, while scrum is more of a sprint style work flow.  We chose to review the Scrum flavor as that seemed to more closely correspond to sprints in Agile Development.  
Agilean allows many users to view the progress of the  many projects. Users have roles for each project, Users are developers on some projects, but may be managers/team leads on other projects.  
On the requirements tab managers create Epics.  Epics are assigned to projects. User Stories are assigned to epics. Tasks are assigned to user stories. And sub-tasks can be associated with tasks. Tasks are assigned story points.Tasks can be tagged with custom tags, and colored from a set of predefined colors, teams are able to use these in indicate whatever they need. A task may be tagged however a team finds useful.  
  
Managers then create Sprints and Releases, and assign tasks to them.  
Projects -> Epics -> User Stories -> tasks (->sub-tasks)  
Releases -> Sprints-> tasks

## Project Overview  
Here you bring together your introduction and lessons learned from the reviews. What are you doing the same, what is different?  
  
  
## Project Architecture  
Your overview should lead naturally into your architecture. Here you have to do the best you can if you have limited experience. Decide based on your vision of what your project should be with the understanding that you may have to learn some specific technologies later. You do not have specify specific technology now. If you are going to use an SQL database to store task data, then just say that and use that language on any diagrams.  
  
  
## Requirements  
Your discussion so far should be causing your to think about delineating specific requirements. While I don't want to state that you need some specific number, look at some of the example projects on Ivan Marsik's website to get a sense of scope. If you don't have between one and two dozen requirements, you probably have not done enough work.  
  
  
## Use Cases  
Your requirements and previous sections should lead to your use cases. How will users use the system? What are the types of users?  This sections should include detailed use cases as well as an accountability matrix that ties your requirements to your use cases.
